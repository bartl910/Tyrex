  <h2>Diet of a T-Rex</h2>
</article>
  <p>Besides fossilized stomach contents, teeth are our best clues to the diets of dinosaurs. The teeth of carnivorous animals are usually sharp, serrated dagger-like blades. These teeth help the animal both to kill the prey and to slice the meat before swallowing. T. rex didnâ€™t chop or grind its food; it swallowed chunks whole. In addition to its sharp, serrated teeth, the lower jaw of T. rex had a joint midway through its length that may have helped absorb some of the shock generated by struggling prey.</p>
